### A simple three-layer neural net, implemented in Rust

This is a simple, three-layer neural net implemented with only basic linear algebra operations. Not including the input matrix, there are two hidden layers (two weights vectors), and the resulting output layer. The activation of both layers is the [sigmoid logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function).

This is mostly supposed to be a minmal example, but it's currently working. If you see something wrong either in the math or the implementation, please file an issue to let me know! This was a learning exercise for me, so any constructive feedback would certainly be welcome!
